# Deep Learning Analysis on Google Stock Data 

 In this project, I coded various recurrent neural network models like LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Attention for predicting Google stock prices. 
 Before diving into the advanced RNN model, I'm going to say what RNN is 

 
## Definition of RNN 

We can summarize the main characteristics of RNN in three sentences.
* Recurrent neural network is one of the deep learning models, which is specialized in time series data. 
* Mostly, the model is used for language-relevant tasks like speech recognition. But it also shows its strength when it comes to analyzing stock data.
* Unlike general neural network models, the output from the node enters into the same node as an input. You can see the general structure of RNN below.
